# logger-wrappers

## Why
* Because sometime I will need it in projects, why not have it prepared?
* I need practice

## How
* Using KIFS
* As few macros as possible
* Unit tests via google tests

## What
* Simple Class wrappers
* CLion as main editor
* CMake
* Static library

## Warning
* This is experiment
* Some stuff might not work outside of CLion - do not know that editor enough (yet)
